Data Security: Implement industry-standard encryption and security practices to protect sensitive data.
Location Services: Integrate with the native location APIs for accurate and efficient geolocation functionality.
Offline Functionality: Cache data locally to allow for data entry in areas with poor or no internet connection, with automatic sync when the connection is re-established.
Development and Release Plan:
Phase 1: Develop and release the core app with essential data entry features and Quest domain authentication.
Phase 2: Add admin features, data normalization, and dynamic form updates.
Phase 3: Implement the dashboard with visualization and CSV export features, along with geolocation checks to avoid duplicate entries.
By launching the app in phases, you can start gathering market intelligence quickly and refine the app based on real user feedback. This incremental approach aligns with Agile methodology and allows for continuous improvement while keeping development focused on high-priority features.

Phase 1: Core Functionality
Backend:
Set up a basic server infrastructure: Configure cloud services and set up server instances.
Database Initialization: Design and implement a database schema to store user inputs.
Authentication System: Develop an OAuth 2.0 based authentication system to allow users to log in with their Quest domain credentials.
API Endpoints: Create RESTful API endpoints for the core data entry features, including brand, location, and terminal details.
Frontend:
Basic UI Development: Create the initial screens for login, data entry forms for the mandatory fields, and a simple confirmation screen upon submission.
Form Handling: Implement form logic to handle data input, validation, and submission to the backend.
Integration with Backend: Ensure the frontend can communicate effectively with the backend, handling authentication and data submission.
Parallel Development Considerations:
While the backend team sets up the basic infrastructure, the frontend team can work on mock interfaces and local form handling.
Once basic API endpoints are available, frontend development can begin integrating with these services.
Phase 2: Admin Features and Data Enhancements
Backend:
Dynamic Form Configuration: Implement a system that allows backend admins to add or modify data points without frontend updates.
Data Normalization Logic: Create logic for handling case insensitivity and other data normalization needs to prevent duplicates.
Admin Editing Interface: Develop an admin interface for managing dropdown options and other configurable form elements.
Frontend:
Dynamic Form Elements: Adjust the data entry forms to be able to change based on backend configurations.
User Feedback Mechanisms: Develop in-app notifications or messages to inform users of successful or pending actions.
Parallel Development Considerations:
The frontend can work on UI components for dynamic content while the backend creates the necessary APIs.
Frontend may develop a temporary admin panel to simulate changes until the backend admin interface is ready.
Phase 3: Advanced Features and Polishing
Backend:
Dashboard and Data Visualization: Develop backend support for data aggregation and visualization.
CSV Export Functionality: Implement a service to generate and provide CSV exports of data.
Geolocation Services: Integrate geolocation APIs to prevent duplicate entries based on location.
Frontend:
Dashboard UI: Create a dashboard interface within the app for real-time data visualization.
Export Options: Provide a UI for exporting data to CSV directly from the app.
Geolocation Integration: Implement frontend geolocation checks and UI prompts for duplicate location handling.
Parallel Development Considerations:
Frontend and backend teams can collaborate closely on the dashboard and geolocation features to ensure seamless integration and user experience.
Frontend can implement placeholder visualizations while backend works on the data aggregation logic.
General Development Strategy:
Agile Methodology: Use an iterative development process with regular sprints, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustment.
Testing: Implement unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT) at each phase to ensure quality and stability.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Set up pipelines to automate testing and deployment, allowing for quick iterations.
Starting with the backend ensures that the fundamental services and data structures are in place, which is crucial for the frontend to function correctly. The frontend then builds upon this foundation, providing the interface through which users will interact with your app. This phased approach allows for building out complexity in manageable steps and ensures that you can test and refine features with real user feedback before moving on to the next set of features.

Market Intelligence Form & Reporting:
MVP Considerations:
Form Submission: Develop the mobile app with a basic form for market intelligence data entry. This form will include only the mandatory fields for early adopters to submit the required information.
Database API: Set up an API for the mobile app to submit data to the backend database. This API will handle requests and responses for storing and retrieving data.
ELK Stack Integration: Integrate with ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for storing, searching, and visualizing the data. Initially, provide basic dashboards with key metrics for internal use.
Application Updates & Version Handling:
MVP Considerations:
App Store Presence: Deploy the initial version of the app to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, ensuring it's accessible for your staff to download.
Update Notifications: Implement a simple notification system within the app to alert users of new updates available, prompting them to download the latest version from the app stores.
AWS App Version Handler: Utilize AWS services for backend operations, including app version management and updates. This can be achieved by using AWS services like AWS CodeDeploy for automated deployment.
Feedback Form Submission:
MVP Considerations:
In-App Feedback Mechanism: Incorporate a basic feedback form within the app that allows users to submit their experiences or issues directly from their devices.
Internal Email Routing: Connect the feedback form to your internal mail server so that submissions are directly forwarded to the product teamâ€™s mail group for review and action.
Technical Implementation for MVP:
Frontend (Mobile App):

A simple, clean UI for form submission with mandatory fields.
In-app alerts for new updates.
An integrated feedback submission form.
Backend:

RESTful API services for handling form data submission.
Database operations for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions on the collected data.
Basic ELK stack setup for initial data visualization purposes.
DevOps:

A CI/CD pipeline for seamless app updates, utilizing GitHub or Bitbucket for source control and AWS App Version Handler for deployment.
Email service setup for feedback routing.
By aligning the MVP development with this system topology, you ensure a coherent and scalable product from the start. The MVP will focus on the primary value proposition and essential features, allowing early adopters to effectively use the product while providing feedback for future iterations. As the product matures, you can build upon this foundation, adding more sophisticated features and integrations as dictated by user feedback and business requirements.
